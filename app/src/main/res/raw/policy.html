            <p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong> We collect personal information that you provide to us.</p>
            <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>
            <div><strong>Information Provided by You</strong></div>
            <p>The information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The information we collect may include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IP Address</li>
                <li>Browser identification</li>
                <li>E-mail address</li>
            </ul>
            <div><strong>Sensitive Information</strong></div>
            <p>We do not process sensitive information.</p>
            <div><strong>Application Data</strong></div>
            <p> If you use our application(s), we also may collect the following information if you choose to provide us with access or permission:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile Device Access. We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device's and other features. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
            <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>

            <h2 id="infouse">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</p>
            <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To protect our Services. We may process your information as part of our efforts to keep our Services safe and secure, including fraud monitoring and prevention.</li>
                <li>To save or protect an individual's vital interest. We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="legalbases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
            <p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>
            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
            <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
            <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
                <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
                <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
                <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
                <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
                <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
                <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
                <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
                <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
                <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="whoshare">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>
            <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
                <li>Affiliates. We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Notice. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="inforetain">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <h2 id="infosafe">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

            <h2 id="privacyrights">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>
            <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section <a data-custom-class="link" href="#contact">
                <span style="color: rgb(0, 58, 250)"> HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</span>
            </a> below.</p>
            <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>
            <p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
            <span class="heading_2">Withdrawing your consent:</span>
            <p>  If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section <a data-custom-class="link" href="#contact">
                <span style="color: rgb(0, 58, 250)">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</span>
            </a> below.</p>
            <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
            <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at hello@ictrust.ch.</p>

            <h2 id="DNT">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
            <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>

            <h2 id="uslaws">9. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong> If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable law. More information is provided below.</p>
            <br/>
