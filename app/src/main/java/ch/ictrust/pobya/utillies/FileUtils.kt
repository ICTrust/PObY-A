     *  TO-DO:
     *     Important: HTML, ASCII, Javascript are all normalized:
     *
     *         ASCII - All lowercase.
     *         HTML - Whitespace transformed to spaces, tags/tag attributes normalized, all lowercase.
     *         Javascript - All strings are normalized (hex encoding is decoded), numbers are parsed
     *              and normalized, local variables/function names are normalized to n001 format, argument to eval() is parsed as JS again, unescape() is handled, some simple JS packers are handled, output is whitespace normalized.
