PObY-A, Privacy Owned by You - Android, is a security and privacy application for Android devices to improve security and privacy of their devices. It uses ClamAV database to scan for malware and warn users about apps with dangerous permissions. It also enforces some settings based on CIS recommendations.

Malware scan is offline and based on two databases:
- ClamAV database, which is updated daily. The app will download the database when it is outdated.
- PObY-A database, managed by ICTrust.
